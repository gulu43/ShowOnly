Photok is a free and open-source gallery app for Android.
 Imported media files are encrypted on the device using AES-256 and only decrypted in memory when using the app.
  This makes Photok different from other encrypted gallery apps.

Photok is completely free, open source, and ad-free. It is developed as a hobby by me (Leon) and public volunteers.
